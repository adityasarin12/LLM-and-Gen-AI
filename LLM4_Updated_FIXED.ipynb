      "design and the associated leadership model that have played \n",
      "a crucial role in the company’s innovation success.\n",
      "When Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional \n",
      "structure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided \n",
      "into business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. \n",
      "General managers ran the Macintosh products group, the \n",
      "information appliances division, and the server products \n",
      "division, among others. As is often the case with decentral-\n",
      "ized business units, managers were inclined to fight with \n",
      "one another, over transfer prices in particular. Believing that \n",
      "conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs, in \n",
      "his first year returning as CEO, laid off the general managers \n",
      "of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire com-\n",
      "pany under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional \n",
      "departments of the business units into one functional organi-\n",
      "zation. (See the exhibit “ Apple’s Functional Organization. ”)\n",
      "The adoption of a functional structure may have been \n",
      "un\n",
      " surprisin\n",
      "g for a company of Apple’s size at the time. What is \n",
      "surprising—in fact, remarkable—is that Apple retains it today, \n",
      "even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms \n",
      "of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1998. Senior \n",
      "vice presidents are in charge of functions, not products. As \n",
      "was the case with Jobs before him, CEO Tim Cook occupies the \n",
      "only position on the organizational chart where the design, \n",
      "engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple’s \n",
      "main products meet. In effect, besides the CEO, the company \n",
      "operates with no conventional general managers: people \n",
      "who control an entire process from product development \n",
      "through sales and are judged according to a P&L statement.\n",
      "Business history and organizational theory make the case \n",
      "that as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they \n",
      "must shift from a functional to a multidivisional structure to \n",
      "align accountability and control and prevent the congestion \n",
      "that occurs when countless decisions flow up the org chart \n",
      "to the very top. Giving business unit leaders full control over \n",
      "key functions allows them to do what is best to meet the \n",
      "needs of their individual units’ customers and maximize \n",
      "their results, and it enables the executives overseeing them \n",
      "to assess their performance. As the Harvard Business School \n",
      "historian Alfred Chandler documented, U.S. companies such \n",
      "as DuPont and General Motors moved from a functional to \n",
      "a multidivisional structure in the early 20th century. By the \n",
      "latter half of the century the vast majority of large corpora-\n",
      "tions had followed suit. Apple proves that this conventional \n",
      "approach is not necessary and that the functional structure \n",
      "may benefit companies facing tremendous technological \n",
      "change and industry upheaval.\n",
      "Apple’s commitment to a functional organization does \n",
      "not mean that its structure has remained static. As the \n",

      "Apple’s main purpose is to create products that enrich \n",
      "people’s daily lives. That involves not only developing \n",
      "entirely new product categories such as the iPhone and the \n",
      "Apple Watch, but also continually innovating within those \n",
      "categories. Perhaps no product feature better reflects Apple’s \n",

      "devoted only six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote \n",

      "To create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure \n",
      "that centers on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief \n",
      "is that those with the most expertise and experience in a \n",
      "domain should have decision rights for that domain. This \n",
      "is based on two views: First, Apple competes in markets \n",
      "where the rates of technological change and disruption are \n",
      "high, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people \n",
      "with deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for \n",
      "disruption. Long before it can get market feedback and solid \n",
      "market forecasts, the company must make bets about which \n",
      "technologies and designs are likely to succeed in smart-\n",
      "phones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts \n",
      "rather than general managers increases the odds that those \n",
      "bets will pay off.\n",

That involves not only developing \\nentirely new product categories such as the iPhone and the \\nApple Watch, but also continually innovating within those \\ncategories. Perhaps no product feature better reflects Apple’s \\ncommitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone cam-\\nera. When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs \\ndevoted only six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote \\nevent for unveiling new products. Since then iPhone camera \\ntechnology has contributed to the photography industry \\nwith a stream of innovations: High dynamic range imaging \\n(2010), panorama photos (2012), True Tone flash (2013), opti-\\ncal image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens camera (2016), \\nportrait mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017), and night mode \\n(2019) are but a few of the improvements.\\nTo create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure \\nthat centers on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief \\nis that those with the most expertise and experience in a \\ndomain should have decision rights for that domain. This \\nis based on two views: First, Apple competes in markets \\nwhere the rates of technological change and disruption are \\nhigh, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people \\nwith deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for \\ndisruption. Long before it can get market feedback and solid \\nmarket forecasts, the company must make bets about which \\ntechnologies and designs are likely to succeed in smart-\\nphones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts \\nrather than general managers increases the odds that those \\nbets will pay off.\\nSecond, Apple’s commitment to offer the best possible \\nproducts would be undercut if short-term profit and cost \\nABOUT THE ART\\nApple Park, Apple’s corporate headquarters in  \\nCupertino, California, opened in 2017.\\nMikael Jansson/Trunk Archive\\nFOR ARTICLE REPRINTS CALL 800-988-0886 OR 617-783-7500, OR VISIT HBR.ORG\\nHarvard Business Review\\nNovember–December 2020 \\u20095'),\n",

Much less well known are the organizational \\ndesign and the associated leadership model that have played \\na crucial role in the company’s innovation success.\\nWhen Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional \\nstructure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided \\ninto business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. \\nGeneral managers ran the Macintosh products group, the \\ninformation appliances division, and the server products \\ndivision, among others. As is often the case with decentral-\\nized business units, managers were inclined to fight with \\none another, over transfer prices in particular. Believing that \\nconventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs, in \\nhis first year returning as CEO, laid off the general managers \\nof all the business units (in a single day), put the entire com-\\npany under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional \\ndepartments of the business units into one functional organi-\\nzation. (See the exhibit “ Apple’s Functional Organization. ”)\\nThe adoption of a functional structure may have been \\nun\\n surprisin\\ng for a company of Apple’s size at the time. What is \\nsurprising—in fact, remarkable—is that Apple retains it today, \\neven though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms \\nof revenue and far more complex than it was in 1998. Senior \\nvice presidents are in charge of functions, not products. As \\nwas the case with Jobs before him, CEO Tim Cook occupies the \\nonly position on the organizational chart where the design, \\nengineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple’s \\nmain products meet. In effect, besides the CEO, the company \\noperates with no conventional general managers: people \\nwho control an entire process from product development \\nthrough sales and are judged according to a P&L statement.\\nBusiness history and organizational theory make the case \\nthat as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they'),\n",

So they charged the algorithm \\nteams with achieving the same effect. When the teams suc-\\nceeded, they knew they had an acceptable standard.\\nAnother issue that emerged was the ability to preview a \\nportrait photo with a blurred background. The camera team \\nhad designed the feature so that users could see its effect on \\ntheir photos only after they had been taken, but the human \\ninterface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting that users \\nshould be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance \\nabout how to make adjustments before taking the photo. \\nJohnnie Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera \\nteam a demo. “When we saw the demo, we realized that this \\nis what we needed to do, ” Townsend told us. The members \\nof his camera hardware team weren’t sure they could do \\nit, but difficulty was not an acceptable excuse for failing to \\ndeliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After \\nmonths of engineering effort, a key stakeholder, the video \\nengineering team (responsible for the low-level software that \\ncontrols sensor and camera operations) found a way, and the \\ncollaboration paid off. Portrait mode was central to Apple’s \\nmarketing of the iPhone 7 Plus. It proved a major reason for \\nusers’ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of the phone.\\nAs this example shows, Apple’s collaborative debate \\ninvolves people from various functions who disagree, push \\nback, promote or reject ideas, and build on one another’s \\nideas to come up with the best solutions. It requires open-\\n \\nmindedness fr\\nom senior leaders. It also requires those \\nleaders to inspire, prod, or influence colleagues in other  \\nareas to contribute toward achieving their goals.\\nWhile Townsend is accountable for how great the camera \\nis, he needed dozens of other teams—each of which had a \\nlong list of its own commitments—to contribute their time and \\neffort to the portrait mode proj\\n ect.

The answer is collaborative \\ndebate. Because no function is responsible for a product or a \\nservice on its own, cross-functional collaboration is crucial.\\nWhen debates reach an impasse, as some inevitably do, \\nhigher-level managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at \\ntimes the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed with \\nsufficient attention to detail is challenging for even the best \\nof leaders, making it all the more important that the company \\nfill many senior positions from within the ranks of its VPs, \\nwho have experience in Apple’s way of operating.\\nHowever, given Apple’s size and scope, even the executive \\nteam can resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The \\nmany horizontal dependencies mean that ineffective peer \\nrelationships at the VP and director levels have the potential \\nto undermine not only particular proj\\n ec\\nts but the entire \\ncompany. Consequently, for people to attain and remain in \\na leadership position within a function, they must be highly \\neffective collaborators.\\nThat doesn’t mean people can’t express their points of \\nview. Leaders are expected to hold strong, well-grounded \\nviews and advocate forcefully for them, yet also be willing  \\nto change their minds when presented with evidence \\nthat others’ views are better. Doing so is not always \\neasy, of course. A leader’s ability to be both partisan and \\nopen-minded is facilitated by two things: deep understand-\\ning of and devotion to the company’s values and common \\npurpose, and a commitment to separating how right from \\nhow hard a particular path is so that the difficulty of execut-\\ning a decision doesn’t prevent its being selected.\\nThe development of the iPhone’s portrait mode illustrates \\na fanatical attention to detail at the leadership level, intense \\ncollaborative debate among teams, and the power of a shared \\npurpose to shape and ultimately resolve debates. In 2009 \\nHubel had the idea of developing an iPhone feature that \\nwould allow people to take portrait photos with bokeh—'),\n",

      "The question asks for the authors and publisher of the article. The context provides the names of the authors (Morten T. Hansen and Joel M.
